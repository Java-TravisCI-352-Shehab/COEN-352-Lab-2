It would be best if you cloned the code repository.

* Firstly, you need to install the Git software, then use the commands below:
* Git command to clone `git clone [repository_URL]`, where  [repository_URL] is the copied URL from the green button with name code.
  * If you are not familiar with git commands, download the code repository as a zip file and extract it.
* Inside directory [Lab 2](https://github.com/Java-TravisCI-352-Shehab/COEN-352-Lab-2/tree/master/Lab%202), you will find all supported files that used during zoom session.
